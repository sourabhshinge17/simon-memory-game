# Simon Game 🎮

A web-based interactive replica of the classic electronic memory game, Simon. Built as part of my web development journey to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure
* **CSS3:** Styling and layout
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Game logic, sequence generation, and user interaction

## 🧠 How to Play
1. The game will flash a sequence of colors.
2. Memorize the sequence.
3. Click the colors in the exact same order.
4. With each correct round, the sequence gets longer and faster. One wrong click, and it's game over!
